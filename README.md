## QuickFileRename
Quick script for renaming multiple files in a numeric order.

# Why?
I got some files with a whole lot of bs in the names and i like my tv series to be organized...idk. 

# How to?

Assuming you have python 3 installed, if not: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Copy the rename.py script into a folder containing the episodes you wish to rename.
Open a terminal to the folder (you can literally just write "cmd" in the windows explorer to open to current directory)
Enter "python ./rename.py --name="<whatever you want to call your files"
Optional: run the command with --test=True first time to see what your files will look like when outputted. 

Note, if multiple numbers already exist in the file, the script will prompt you to decide which set of numbers are the episodes.
